				<p>
					I am a passionate software engineering student at <strong>Link√∂pings Universitet</strong>, currently pursuing a 
					<strong> B.Sc. in Computer Science and Software Engineering</strong> and a <strong>M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The program has provided me with a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, databases and 
					collaborative project management. Through both coursework and voluntary projects, I have acquired hands-on experience in a variety of areas, from software development and project management to sales and organizational tasks.
				</p>

				<p>
					Beyond academics, I enjoy taking part in student organizations, managing projects, and continuously 
					improving my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
